									Dynasty of the Sands is a colony sim survival city builder set in ancient Egypt.
									This is the first project I started on when I joined the Rocket Flair team so I've 
									worked on a lot of areas of the project which includes amongst other things:
								</p>
								<dl>
									<dt>Villager Jobs</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											The Villager Jobs system is kind of based off of a state machine. Each villager has a Job and within that Job class they have 
											specific behaviour, but each Job also has a set of Actions(States) that they can be in and each of these Actions has more specific
											behaviour. So for instance a Villager can be a Farmer which is a Job and as part of that Job there are Actions like SearchForPlot, Planting,
											Harvesting, DeliveringResources etc. These Actions separate out the behaviour into classes which I designed and implemented to make it easier
											to create Jobs and behaviour for villagers as well as make it more readable.
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Lenses</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											The main example of this is the Water Lens. The goal was to create a visual to show the range of water sources therefore knowing if a 
											villager has access to drinking water.<br>

											<b>Solution:</b> I use the pathfinding grid along with the water nodes to make a texture or "water map" with different types of water (Dirty & Clean) corresponding
											to a different colour channel on the texture. I do it this way so that the ShaderGraph shader can change what colours are used for display 
											based on what colourblind mode is selected.
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Terrain tools</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											The game requires changing terrain height maps and splat maps at runtime so we need ways to fetch that data.<br>

											<b>Solution:</b> I wrote some functionality to fetch splatmap data from the current terrain as well as neighbouring terrains 
											within the bounds of a rect. We need access to the specific splat map data because the weights are used for ground
											efficiency calculations like Farming or Mudpits.
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Performance</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											It's important to keep on top of performance so I frequently check out CPU and GPU performance as well as memory management.
											If there's anything strange or areas where there's spikes in usage I'll look deeper to see what if any refactors are required.
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Resource Gathering</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											The Gatherers and Woodcutters interact with the trees and bushes to get resources, but these are just TreeInstances which 
											only holds certain data that is useful but we need more for resource gatherers.<br>

											<b>Solution:</b> Any resource gathering building finds all TreeInstances in range and will create an instance of an object that 
											holds all relevant data from the TreeInstance as well as data for the resource like the current amount available or time before 
											regrowth. There's also an object manager that keeps control of all of these object instances.
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Unity Jobs</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											Part of the gathering system requires that there be UI to tell the player how many valid resources there are in the area of 
											a building while it's being placed.<br>

											<b>Solution:</b> The building looks at all of the trees on the current and neighbouring terrains for trees in range, 
											so since there is a possibility that there are thousands of trees being evaluated and it needs to be done quickly 
											I thought that using the Unity Jobs system would be appropriate. The job does distance checks on all of the tree 
											positions and outputs the tree IDs of the ones in range.
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>UI</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											With large amounts of UI such as in this project it's kind of a daunting task to keep it correctly updated. Lots of 
											elements need to correctly reflect current stats and amounts etc.<br>

											<b>Solution:</b> So I made an effort to implement something like an MVC pattern to handle UI updates when the state 
											of certain objects change, like the health of a villager or construction progress of a building.

								<h3>Surviving the Abyss</h3>

								<p style = "padding-top: 10px;">
									Surviving the Abyss is a colony sim survival city builder with an element of horror and is the third game in the "Surviving" franchise.
									I started working on this project shortly after I joined Rocket Flair in 2021 to port over one of the systems from DotS but I've worked
									on a lot of the core systems since.
								</p>

								<dl>
									<dt>Octagonal grid</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											The grid is an 8 direction grid graph which uses the A* Pathfinding Project Package, this allowed us to create a unique looking octagonal grid.
											It presented some challenges with building placement as not all of the grid spaces are immediately adjacent and not 
											all of the buildings are the same footprints. For instance, a building with a footprint of 2x2 and a building with a footprint of
											2x3 cannot use the same position snapping or rotation code.<br>
											This grid drives a number of the decisions for other systems as well.
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Building footprints</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											Buildings are designed with specific rules, they have to occupy an area that is in multiples of the octagonal grid spaces such as 2x2 or 
											3x5. They can be irregular shaped but they must follow rules driven by the grid. This means we can store exactly which grid spaces a building
											would occupy which comes in handy for our building placement validation as each node in the grid graph also stores info about the Terrain.
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Tunnel System</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											The grid is an 8 direction grid graph so each grid space is a node for pathfinding and the tunnel system uses this pathfinding grid to pick
											which waypoints to build a tunnel along, which means each grid space can be thought of as a potential starting point for a tunnel as well. 
											This all leads to a system where we can specify which of the gridspaces a building occupies should be a TunnelConnection and which direction the connection should be.<br>
											
											Another challenging part of this system is how to create junctions where tunnels join other tunnels. The solution became a sort of direction ID
											which would correspond to a specific Junction prefab along with a scale and rotation to apply to the junction.
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Performance</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											StA plays with light and dark a lot so there are some interesting methods to save on performance. LOD components change which mesh 
											is used on an object based on the object's size on screen, but since a lot of the objects are in the dark I designed an LOD swapper 
											that would change the LOD thresholds based on the objects proximity to a light source
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Threat system</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											The anomaly monster in the game runs on a system kind of like a state machine. It has different states in which
											it can perform different actions based on the current stage of the game as well as number and types of buildings 
											present.
