									<h3>CLEAR Dementia Care App</h3>

										This was the largest project I took on during my time at Sentireal and it was for the Northern Health and Social Care Trust.
										They have a team of dementia care researchers and psychologists that put together a system called C.L.E.A.R that is meant to help carers
										of people with dementia.<br>
										
										The project was to create an app that would aid carers by providing learning information about the CLEAR system as well as tools 
										to help utilise the CLEAR principles.<br>

										The app was developed with React Native and Expo tools as we were required to release on both Android and iOS devices. 
										I had never worked with Javascript before so I learned whilst doing the project.<br>

										Over the course of around a year I developed the project to feature:
										<ul>
											<li>
												A wordpress driven information section. The app queries a wordpress content management site that returns a json object. This object then gets
												deserialised into a SQLite database. I would definitely not do it this way second time around, at the time I thought this would be a good way for 
												pages within the app to be able to link to each other but it overcomplicated everything and the json object was probably enough to generate the 
												page views on the app.
											</li>
											<li>
												Patient profile creation. The user is able to create password protected profiles to keep track of individual patient information.
											</li>
											<li>
												Time tracking system. The user can record a time and date entry with information and filter tags about what state the patient was in at that 
												date and time.
											</li>
											<li>
												The patient profiles and time data can be backed up to an Amazon S3 bucket over an encrypted connection.
											</li>
											<li>
												The time data is displayed in a custom date and time range view and can be exported to a pdf file.
											</li>
										</ul>

										This project was in partnership with the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council amongst other funders to create 
										a companion tourism application. It featured information about multiple historical and fantastical sites within the 
										council area, audio pieces with actors performing stories from the area, and little interactive bits to highlight parts
										of the stories.<br>

										My part of development was in Android Studio with Java. I set up all of the screens and navigation and implemented the 
										bespoke UI and interactive elements.

									<p style = "padding-top: 10px;">
										My first VR project. In partnership with a local theatre company. They wanted a VR app with multiple experiences.
										We filmed multiple 360 videos for playback in the app. We made a 3D underwater experience to be a part of one of their 
										recycling projects. You had to pick up plastic bottles from a river bed while walking along the bed.<br>

										I used the Virtual Reality Toolkit (VRTK) package for Unity to set up common VR interactions and scenes like point and select and grabbing. All of the scenes use the 
										pointer interactions for UI interaction and the underwater scene uses the grab interaction as well.
